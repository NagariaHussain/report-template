# Introduction

As I was coding along with the lectures and completing the worksheets, by the end of the course, I already had the [basic functionality](#r1-basic-functionality) in place.

I planned to start with the [playlist component](#r3-the-music-library), since I found it interesting and also very essential for such an application. Once, I was done with the playlist component, I moved to give the GUI an [overhaul](#r4-the-new-gui-layout). At the very last, I worked on the [custom deck control](#r2-the-custom-deck-control) and added some finishing touches. I have used a variety of different things available in the **JUCE Library** and used the JUCE *documentation*[^1] for learning about different classes and methods available on those classes.

Detailed information on the achievements of different requirements makes the rest of this report. I have attached **screenshots** and **code snippets** at various places to make things clearer.
